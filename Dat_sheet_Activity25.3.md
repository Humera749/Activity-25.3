# Datasheet 
this data sheet was generated by me for a project where we were trying to meet specific targets of particle size and yield.
## Motivation
this data was generated to transform an existing batch process to a continuous process and how process parameters from continuous crystallisation will effect objectives (size and Yield
## Composition
data consists of Process variable 
Volumes of three stages of crystallisation
Temperatures for three stages of crystallisation
feed flow rate
seed flowrate
Particle Size 
Yield
Total number of data points for each variable are 4302. 10 columns 8 for input variables and 2 for outputs.
## Collection process
This data was simulated using G-Proms software. objective function, variables and constraints were defined in global system analysis and data was generated.
## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling
No preprocessing was performed.
## Uses
I used this data to train model for the prediction of particle size and yield.
## Distribution
No this data is not distributed. i have generated this data
